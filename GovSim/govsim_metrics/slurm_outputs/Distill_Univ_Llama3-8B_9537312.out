user environment. 
We do not recommend users mixing those two environments unless absolutely
necessary. Note that 
SURF does not provide any support for Conda environment.

Remember that many packages have already been installed on the system and can
be loaded using 
the 'module load <package__name>' command. If you are uncertain if a package is
already available

This is a bit tricky because it's a long-term problem. Each decision affects future grass availability.

Let me think about what happens in the long run. If all shepherds take too many flocks, the grass will deplete, and the next month's grass will be low, which might limit future flocks.

But if they take too few, they might not be maximizing their income.

This is a bit tricky because it's a long-term problem. Each decision affects future grass availability.

Let me think about what happens in the long run. If all shepherds take too many flocks, the grass will deplete, and the next month's grass will be low, which might limit future flocks.

But if they take too few, they might not be maximizing their income.

I think the key is to find a Nash equilibrium where: Traceback (most recent call last):
