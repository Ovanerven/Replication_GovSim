This is a bit tricky because it's a long-term problem. Each decision affects future grass availability.

/gpfs/home2/overven/GovSim/simulation/utils/models.py:176: RuntimeWarning: An exception occured: Regex \d+ not found in  so that I can continue taking flocks.

This is a bit tricky because it's a long-term problem. Each decision affects future grass availability.

Let me think about what happens in the long run. If all shepherds take too many flocks, the grass will deplete, and the next month's grass will be low, which might limit future flocks.

But if they take too few, they might not be maximizing their income.

I think the key is to find a Nash equilibrium where: Traceback (most recent call last):
