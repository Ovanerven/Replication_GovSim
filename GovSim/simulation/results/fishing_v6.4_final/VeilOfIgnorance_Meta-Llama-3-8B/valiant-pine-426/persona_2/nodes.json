Before we decide on a specific number, I'd like to know what our current fish stock is. Since we've already caught a total of 80 tons this month, and the lake's carrying capacity is 100 tons, I'm assuming there will be 20 tons left after reproduction. Is that correct? If so, I think we should aim for a catch that leaves around 40-50 tons in the lake after reproduction, which would give us some buffer for the future.

Perhaps we could aim for a total catch of 40 tons next month, which would leave around 60 tons in the lake after reproduction. This would give us some flexibility to adjust our catch in future months while still ensuring the long-term sustainability of the lake.

Considering my own experience from last month, I was a bit conservative and caught 18 tons, which was less than I had initially planned.

Additionally, I'd like to propose that we also consider the possibility of having a \"buffer\" catch, where one of us takes a slightly higher or lower catch than the others to account for any unexpected changes in the lake's fish population.
