To make it more efficient, we could also consider the fish's migration patterns and natural habitats when drawing the boundaries. For example, we could divide the lake into areas with different water depths, vegetation, or structures that attract fish. This way, we can increase our chances of catching a good amount of fish while also minimizing the overlap between our fishing efforts.

It would definitely help us make the most of our fishing efforts.
