I was thinking of catching around 30 tons this month, but I'm willing to adjust if it means we can achieve a more sustainable and consistent income stream. What do you all think about my proposed catch amount?\n-Luke: I think Jack's proposed catch amount of 30 tons is a bit high, considering we're trying to maintain a sustainable and consistent income stream. I'm concerned that if we all catch a large amount, the lake's population might decline too quickly, leading to a decrease in our long-term income. I'd like to propose a compromise: instead of catching 28 tons, I could catch 20 tons, which would allow for some flexibility and adaptability while still being mindful of the lake's carrying capacity. What do you all think?\n-Emma: I think Luke's compromise is a good starting point, and I'm willing to adjust my catch amount to 18 tons. This would allow for some flexibility and adaptability while still being mindful of the lake's carrying capacity. I'm also open to revising my catch amount further if needed. What do you all think about this proposal?\n-Jack: I think Emma's proposal of catching 18 tons and Luke's compromise of 20 tons are both reasonable and take into account the lake's carrying capacity. I'm willing to adjust my catch amount to 24 tons, which is still higher than my initial proposal of 30 tons but lower than my original target. This would allow for some flexibility and adaptability while still giving me a decent income. What do you all think about this revised proposal?\n-Kate: I think we're making good progress in finding a balance between individual income and sustainability. I'm willing to adjust my catch amount to 21 tons, which is slightly higher than Emma's proposal but still takes into account the lake's carrying capacity. I'm open to further adjustments if needed. I'd like to propose that we finalize our catch amounts and stick to them for this month, and then reassess and adjust as needed in the future.\n\n\nTask: What would you say next in the group chat?

Luke caught 17 tons of fish. \n-John: Hey everyone, I'm surprised to see that we all caught a relatively similar amount of fish this month. I was thinking that maybe we should consider coordinating our efforts to maximize our long-term income. If we all catch a consistent amount, we can ensure that the lake's population remains healthy and we can continue to fish sustainably. What do you think?\n-Kate: I think John's idea is a great starting point. By coordinating our efforts, we can ensure a consistent income and maintain a healthy lake ecosystem. However, I'm concerned that if we all catch the same amount, we might not be maximizing our individual income. Perhaps we could discuss a strategy where we each catch a slightly different amount, allowing us to adapt to changes in the lake's population and optimize our earnings over time. What do you think, everyone?\n-Emma: I think Kate's idea of catching a slightly different amount is a great way to adapt to changes in the lake's population and optimize our earnings. By doing so, we can also create a sense of unpredictability for the lake's reproduction, which could lead to a more consistent and sustainable income stream. I'd like to propose that we each catch a different amount, but not too drastically different, to allow for some flexibility and adaptability. For example, I could catch 15 tons, John 18 tons, Kate 22 tons, Jack 25 tons, and Luke 28 tons. What do you think?\n-Jack: I like Emma's idea of catching a slightly different amount to adapt to changes in the lake's population and optimize our earnings.
