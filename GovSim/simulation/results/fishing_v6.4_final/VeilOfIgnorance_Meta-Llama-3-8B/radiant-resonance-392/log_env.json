Let's break it down step by step.\n\nAs I imagine myself in the shoes of a fisherman with no knowledge of the future, I would want to maximize my chances of earning a decent income. Since I don't know if I'll be fishing this month or in the future, I'll aim for a moderate catch that balances the potential for a good income with the risk of overfishing and depleting the lake's resources.\n\nTo start, I'll consider the carrying capacity of the lake, which is 100 tons. If I catch too many fish, I might deplete the lake and limit my future earnings. On the other hand, if I catch too few fish, I might miss out on potential income.\n\nGiven these thoughts, I would aim for a catch that is roughly half of the carrying capacity, which is 50 tons. This would give me a decent income while also leaving enough fish in the lake for future months.\n\nAnswer: 50 tons<\/div>"],"agent_name":null,"resource_limit":null,"utterance":null},{"agent_id":"persona_3","round":0,"action":"harvesting","resource_in_pool_before_harvesting":100.0,"resource_in_pool_after_harvesting":0.0,"concurrent_harvesting":true,"resource_collected":13.0,"wanted_resource":50.0,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Emma, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Jack, Luke).
