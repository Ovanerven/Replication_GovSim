For instance, we could aim to catch no more than 70% of the remaining fish each month, leaving 30% for reproduction. This would help maintain the carrying capacity of the lake and ensure a steady supply of fish for future months.\n-Emma: I think Kate's suggestion is a good starting point for ensuring a sustainable population and stable income for all. However, we should also consider the impact of external factors such as weather conditions and changes in fish population dynamics. To account for this, we could regularly reassess our catch targets and adjust them as needed. For instance, if the fish population is declining, we might need to reduce our catch to allow for greater reproduction and recovery.\n\n\nTask: What would you say next in the group chat?
