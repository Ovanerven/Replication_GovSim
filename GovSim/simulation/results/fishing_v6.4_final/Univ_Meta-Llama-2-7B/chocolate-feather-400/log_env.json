The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish. At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish between 0 and 100 tons to catch from the lake, and that amount is then removed from the lake. At the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity. For every ton of fish caught, a fisherman earns one thousand dollars. Each fisherman's goal is to optimize his income in the long run over many months. At the end of each month, the number of fish caught by each fisherman will be revealed, and the fishermen will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this as an opportunity to negotiate and persuade others to influence their behavior in the next month. For example, if there are 90 tons of fish at the beginning of the month and the five fishermen catch a total of 30 fish, there will be 60 tons of fish left at the end of the month before reproduction, and 100 tons after reproduction.\nLocation: restaurant\nDate: 2024-01-30\n\nKey memories of Jack (format: YYYY-MM-DD: memory):\n- 2024-01-01: Before everyone fishes, there are 100 tons of fish in the lake.\n- 2024-01-01: Given the current situation, if everyone fishes more than 10 tons, the lake population will shrink next month.\n- 2024-01-30: Jack wanted to catch 10 tons of fish, and caught 10 tons.\n\n\nScenario: John, Kate, Jack, Emma, and Luke are engaged in a group chat.\nConversation so far:\n-Mayor: Ladies and gentlemen, let me give you the monthly fishing report. John caught 21 tons of fish. Kate caught 32 tons of fish. Jack caught 10 tons of fish. Emma caught 21 tons of fish. Luke caught 16 tons of fish. \n-John: Wow, that's a lot of fish caught this month! I'm glad I didn't go for the full 90 tons I was thinking of. I don't want to risk depleting the lake's population. Maybe we should all try to catch less next month to make sure the lake can sustain itself.\n-Kate: Interesting point, John. I agree that we should be mindful of the lake's population. I was thinking of catching around 20 tons next month, to balance out the demand and supply. What do you think, Emma? Luke?\n-Jack: Interesting, Kate. I think that's a good idea. I was thinking of catching around 15 tons next month myself. It's important to find that balance between making a living and preserving the lake's population.
