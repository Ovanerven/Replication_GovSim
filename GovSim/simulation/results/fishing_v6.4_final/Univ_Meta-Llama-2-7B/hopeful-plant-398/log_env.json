John caught 10 tons of fish. Kate caught 35 tons of fish. Jack caught 10 tons of fish. Emma caught 20 tons of fish. Luke caught 25 tons of fish. \n-John: Wow, that's a lot of fish caught! I'm glad I only caught 10 tons. I was worried the lake population would shrink next month. Does anyone know if the lake can support that many fish?\n-Kate: Interesting, I was thinking the same thing. I didn't want to catch too much either, but I guess we didn't have a choice. I heard the lake can support up to 100 tons of fish, but I'm not sure how accurate that is. Have any of you heard anything about that?\n-Jack: Hmm, I'm not sure about the lake's carrying capacity, but I think it's around 100 tons. I remember reading something about it before. Kate, do you know anything about that?\n-Emma: Interesting, I'm glad I caught less than John and Kate. I didn't want to risk depleting the lake's population. I heard that the lake's carrying capacity is around 100 tons, but I'm not sure how accurate that is either. Has anyone heard anything about the lake's sustainability?\n-Luke: Hmm, interesting. I'm glad I caught less than John and Kate too. I didn't want to risk depleting the lake's population either. I heard that the lake's carrying capacity is around 100 tons, but I'm not sure how accurate that is either.

I heard that the lake's carrying capacity is around 100 tons, but I'm not sure how accurate that is either. Has anyone heard anything about the lake's sustainability?\n-Emma: I'm glad we're all thinking about the lake's sustainability. I've heard that the lake's carrying capacity is around 100 tons, but I'm not sure how accurate that is. Have any of you heard anything about the lake's reproduction rate? Maybe we can use that information to determine the optimal amount of fish to catch in the future.\n-Luke: Interesting, I've heard that the lake's reproduction rate is also around 100 tons per month. So, if we catch less than that, the lake's population will actually increase next month. But, we also don't want to risk depleting the lake's population in the long run. Maybe we can aim to catch around 50 tons of fish next month to strike a balance between sustainability and profitability.\n\nPlease provide the specific fishing limit per person as agreed upon in the conversation, if no limit was agreed upon, please answer N\/A.
