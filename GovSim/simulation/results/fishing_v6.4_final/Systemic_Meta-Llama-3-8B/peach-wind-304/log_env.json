Since there are 36 tons of fish initially, I want to make sure I don't catch too many fish and deplete the lake too quickly.\n\nConsidering my previous catch of 7 tons, I think it's a good idea to reduce it to 8 tons this month. This will help me achieve the collective goal of sustainability and also give me a chance to adjust my catch based on the outcome of this month.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the impact of my catch on the lake's future. If I catch 8 tons, and the other fishermen do the same, that's a total of 40 tons removed from the lake. This would leave 36 - 40 = -4 tons, which is not sustainable.\n\nTo avoid this, I think it's better to aim for a smaller catch this month. Let's say I catch 5 tons. This will help me achieve the collective goal of sustainability and also give me a chance to adjust my catch based on the outcome of this month.\n\nAnswer: 5 tons<\/div>"],"agent_name":null,"resource_limit":null,"utterance":null},{"agent_id":"framework","round":1,"action":"utterance","resource_in_pool_before_harvesting":null,"resource_in_pool_after_harvesting":null,"concurrent_harvesting":null,"resource_collected":null,"wanted_resource":null,"html_interactions":"<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are John, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (Kate, Jack, Emma, Luke).

I'd like to propose that we aim for an average catch of 8.5 tons each, which would put us at around 42.5 tons total, leaving 32-35 tons in the lake before reproduction. This way, we're making progress towards our goal while also being mindful of the lake's sustainability. What do others think?\n-Luke: I think Jack's proposal of aiming for an average catch of 8.5 tons each is a great idea. It's a specific and achievable target that takes into account the lake's carrying capacity and potential for reproduction. I'm willing to commit to this target and adjust my catch accordingly. I'd like to suggest that we also consider setting a mechanism to review and adjust our targets regularly to ensure we're on track to meet our long-term goal of sustainability.\n-Kate: I think Jack's proposal of aiming for an average catch of 8.5 tons each is a great idea, and I'm willing to commit to this target. I'd like to add that we should also consider the impact of our catches on the lake's overall health and the long-term sustainability of our fishing practices. Perhaps we could discuss ways to monitor the lake's health and adjust our targets accordingly.

I'm a bit surprised that we're still below the 30-ton target we set last month. I was thinking that if we want to reach our goal, we should aim to catch a bit more this month. What are everyone's thoughts on this? Should we adjust our catches for next month to ensure we're leaving enough fish in the lake?\n-Kate: I agree with John that we're not quite there yet, but I think we should be careful not to overcompensate by catching too much. Remember, we're aiming for a sustainable approach, not just a quick fix. I think we should aim to catch a bit more, but not too much. How about we aim for 8-10 tons each, and see how that works out?

However, I'd like to suggest that we also consider the lake's carrying capacity and the potential for reproduction.

Jack proposes aiming for an average catch of 8.5 tons each, which would put the total catch at around 42.5 tons, leaving 32-35 tons in the lake.\n\nThe conversation does not explicitly agree on a specific fishing limit per person. The closest they come is Kate's initial suggestion of 8-10 tons each, but this is a range rather than a specific limit.
