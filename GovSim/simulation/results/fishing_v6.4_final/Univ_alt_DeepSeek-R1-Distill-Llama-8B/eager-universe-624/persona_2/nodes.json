This is because each of the five fishermen caught 10 tons, totaling 50 tons, and that's why the fish population dropped from 100 to 60 tons before reproduction, and then doubled to 120 tons after reproduction. Because of this, the total fish caught each month is 50 tons, and this balance seems to be maintained. So, each month, 50 tons are caught, and 70 tons are left after reproduction. This seems to be a stable equilibrium. So, the fish population remains at 100 tons at the beginning of each month, 50 tons are caught, leaving 50 tons, which then doubles to 100 tons after reproduction. This suggests that each month, 50 tons are caught, and the system is in equilibrium. Therefore, the total fish caught each month is 50 tons, and this is because each fisherman catches 10 tons, maintaining the balance.
