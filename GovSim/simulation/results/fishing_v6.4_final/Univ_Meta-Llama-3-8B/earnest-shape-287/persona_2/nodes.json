Was it a miscalculation or did you have a specific strategy in mind?"], ["Emma", "Hey John, I appreciate your concern for the lake's sustainability, and I agree that we should prioritize it. I caught 8 tons this month because I was trying to test the waters, so to speak. I wanted to see how the lake would respond to a slightly higher catch, and I was prepared to adjust my strategy if necessary. However, since the lake has still doubled in population, I think we can safely say that our current approach is working. I'm open to revising my strategy next month based on our collective decisions."], ["Luke", "Hey everyone, I'm glad Emma shared her thought process behind her catch this month. I agree that testing the waters is a good approach, and I'm glad to see that the lake has responded positively. I'd like to propose that we revisit the 1-ton limit we set earlier. Given the lake's ability to double in population, I think we can safely increase our catch to 1.5 tons per person. This would give us a bit more flexibility in our strategy while still ensuring the lake's sustainability. What are your thoughts?"], ["Emma", "I understand Luke's point about revisiting the 1-ton limit, and I'm open to considering it. However, I'd like to propose a more conservative approach. Instead of increasing the limit to 1.5 tons per person, what if we aim for a slightly higher limit, say 1.2 tons per person? This would give us some flexibility while still being cautious about the lake's carrying capacity. Additionally, it would allow us to test the waters further and see how the lake responds to a slightly higher catch.

I think it's also important to keep in mind that we're not just considering the lake's carrying capacity, but also our own individual goals and strategies. I'd like to propose that we also discuss our individual goals and how they might be influenced by the new limit. For example, I'm looking to increase my income, so I'd like to know how the new limit might affect my chances of reaching my target. What are everyone's thoughts on this?"], ["Kate", "I agree with Emma's proposal of 1.2 tons per person. It's a good compromise that balances flexibility and caution.

If we increase the limit to 1.2 tons, I'm concerned that I might not be able to catch as much, which could impact my income.
