With 100 tons of fish initially and a total catch of 23 tons, we're leaving only 77 tons for reproduction.

However, I'd like to suggest that we consider a slightly more nuanced approach. Instead of a hard cap of 5 tons per person, what if we aim for an average of 5 tons per person, with some flexibility to adjust based on the lake's population?
