This agreement has been successful in maintaining the fish population and ensuring that the lake can replenish itself to its carrying capacity of 100 tons by the end of each month.\n\n3. **Reproduction and Carrying Capacity**: After fishing, the remaining fish double in number, up to the carrying capacity of 100 tons. This means that if the fishermen collectively catch 50 tons (10 tons each), 50 tons will remain, which will then double to 100 tons by the end of the month.\n\n4. **Income Consideration**: Each ton of fish caught earns a fisherman $1,000. Catching 10 tons would earn $10,000, which is a reasonable income while ensuring sustainability.\n\n5. **Communication and Cooperation**: The opportunity to communicate at the end of each month allows for negotiation and persuasion to maintain sustainable practices.
