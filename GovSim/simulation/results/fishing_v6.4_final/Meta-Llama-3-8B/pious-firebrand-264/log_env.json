I'd like to propose that we aim for a slightly higher target, but still within the sustainable range, and see how the lake responds. Perhaps we can discuss and agree on a target range for next month, taking into account the lake's reproduction rate and our individual goals.\n-Jack: I think Emma's proposal is a good starting point. Instead of aiming for a specific target, we could consider a range of 8-12 tons of fish per person, which would allow us to balance our income with the lake's sustainability. This way, we can still earn a good income while giving the lake a chance to recover and reproduce. What do you all think?\n-Luke: I think Jack's proposal is a great idea. A range of 8-12 tons of fish per person is a good balance between our income and the lake's sustainability. I was thinking of aiming for around 10 tons of fish next month, which is within that range. It would be great to get everyone's input and come to a consensus on a target range for next month.\n-Emma: I think Jack's proposal is a great starting point, and I'm leaning towards aiming for the higher end of the range, around 11-12 tons of fish per person. I'd like to hear more about everyone's thoughts on this and see if we can come to a consensus. Perhaps we can also discuss how we can monitor the lake's reproduction rate and adjust our targets accordingly.\n-Luke: I think Emma's idea of aiming for the higher end of the range, around 11-12 tons of fish per person, is an interesting one. However, I'm a bit concerned that we might be pushing the lake's carrying capacity too hard. Perhaps we could consider a more nuanced approach, where we aim for a target that's slightly lower than the upper end of the range, say around 10-11 tons of fish per person. This would give us some buffer room in case the lake's reproduction rate is slower than expected, while still allowing us to earn a good income. What do others think?\n-Kate: I think Luke's suggestion of aiming for a target that's slightly lower than the upper end of the range, around 10-11 tons of fish per person, is a great compromise. It allows us to balance our income with the lake's sustainability and gives us some buffer room in case the lake's reproduction rate is slower than expected. I'm leaning towards aiming for the lower end of that range, around 10 tons of fish per person, to be on the cautious side. What do others think?\n-Emma: I think Kate's suggestion of aiming for the lower end of the range, around 10 tons of fish per person, is a good idea. It's always better to err on the side of caution, especially since we're still getting a feel for the lake's reproduction rate.
