To optimize income in the long run, it is important to consider the carrying capacity of the lake and the reproduction of fish. Given that the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish, it is important to ensure that the total amount of fish caught by all fishermen does not exceed this limit.

To ensure the long-term health of the lake and maximize income for all fishermen, it is important to establish a sustainable fishing limit. Given that the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish, we should aim to catch a total of 100 tons of fish per month. This would allow for the maximum amount of fish to be caught while ensuring that the lake can reproduce and sustain itself in the long run. I suggest that we establish a maximum limit of 20 tons of fish per person per month.
