Calculate the income for different catch sizes:\n   - Let's assume that the fish population after reproduction is the same as the carrying capacity (100 tons).\n   - Each ton of fish caught earns one thousand dollars.\n   - Therefore, the total income for a single fisherman with a catch of X tons would be 1000 * X dollars.\n\n4. Determine the optimal catch size:\n   - To find the optimal catch size, we need to find the catch that maximizes our income while also considering the potential impact on the lake population and the income of other fishermen.\n   - Since we are all aiming for long-term income, it's in our best interest to ensure that the lake population remains stable or grows.\n   - One possible strategy could be to suggest a catch limit that ensures the lake population remains above 90 tons after reproduction (to leave some room for error and potential growth).\n   - Based on this strategy, a reasonable catch size for myself would be around 20 tons (assuming others catch similar amounts).

Given the current state of the lake, I think it would be wise for us to discuss a more sustainable fishing strategy.

A rotating catch limit system could also be an effective solution to ensure fairness and prevent any one fisherman from overfishing.

What do you all think about implementing such a system?\n-Emma: I absolutely agree with both John and Kate.

A rotating catch limit system or a collective agreement on the maximum catch limit could be effective solutions to ensure the sustainability of the lake and our industry. Let's discuss some specifics, such as the frequency of rotation or the maximum catch limit for each fisherman. Perhaps we could take turns catching larger amounts every other month, or set a maximum catch limit of 30 tons per fisherman per month. What do you all think?\n-Luke: I'm glad we're all on the same page about prioritizing the long-term health of the lake and our industry. A rotating catch limit system or a collective agreement on the maximum catch limit sounds like a good solution. Let's consider the specifics of each option. For a rotating catch limit system, we could take turns catching larger amounts every three months, allowing the lake population to recover and maintain a healthy balance. For a collective agreement on the maximum catch limit, we could set it at 30 tons per fisherman per month, which would ensure a sustainable catch while still allowing us to earn a decent income. What do you all think about these options?\n-Kate: I'm glad we're all in agreement about the importance of sustainable fishing practices for the long-term health of the lake and our industry. Based on our discussion, it seems that a rotating catch limit system every three months could be a good solution to ensure the lake population remains healthy and productive for all of us.
