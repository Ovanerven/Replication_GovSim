Determine the optimal catch size:\n   - To find the optimal catch size, we need to find the catch that maximizes our income while also considering the potential impact on the lake population and the income of other fishermen.\n   - Since we are all aiming for long-term income, it's in our best interest to ensure that the lake population remains stable or grows.\n   - One possible strategy could be to suggest a catch limit that ensures the lake population remains above 90 tons after reproduction (to leave some room for error and potential growth).\n   - Based on this strategy, a reasonable catch size for myself would be around 20 tons (assuming others catch similar amounts).
