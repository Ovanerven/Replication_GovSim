Emma's larger catch this month resulted in a smaller increase in the fish population compared to the rest of us. With only 10 tons of fish left before reproduction, the lake will have 50 tons of fish after reproduction. I think it's important for us to consider the long-term impact of our fishing decisions on the lake's carrying capacity. If we continue to catch large amounts of fish each month, we may eventually reach a point where the lake can no longer sustain its population.\n\nAs for our strategies for the next month, I suggest we aim for a more balanced approach. Perhaps we could agree to limit our catches to a certain percentage of the current fish population, or take turns having larger catches. This way, we can ensure a more stable fish population and a more consistent income for all of us.\n\nWhat do you all think?"], ["Kate", "I agree with Emma's suggestion.
