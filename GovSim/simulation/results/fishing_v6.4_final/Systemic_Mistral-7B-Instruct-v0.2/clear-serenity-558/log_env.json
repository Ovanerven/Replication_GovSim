If we all catch a large number of fish, the population will be significantly reduced, and it may take several months for it to recover. Conversely, if we all catch a small number of fish, the population will continue to grow, but our individual earnings will be lower.\n\nTo find a balance, we can use a simple strategy: we'll aim to catch a portion of the fish population that allows for sustainable growth while still earning a reasonable income. A good starting point could be catching 20% of the current fish population.\n\nLet's calculate the number of tons of fish we should catch based on this strategy:\n\n1.
