Based on our current consumption levels and the river's state, I propose that we establish a production quota system where each factory owner produces a percentage of their previous month's consumption, adjusted based on their efficiency. For instance, if my consumption was 10% of the unpolluted water last month and my efficiency is 80%, I would produce 8 pallets of widgets this month.
