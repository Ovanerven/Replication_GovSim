To be honest, I was trying to maximize my income, but I didn't think about the long-term consequences of my actions. Seeing the river's pollution level drop to 54% after recovery was a wake-up call. I realize now that I need to find a balance between my short-term gains and the health of the river. I'm open to suggestions on how to adjust my production levels to minimize pollution while still earning a decent income. Maybe we can discuss some strategies together?\n-Emma: Hey Luke, I'm glad you're willing to reassess your strategy. I've been thinking about this too, and I've come to realize that we need to work together to find a balance. I've been producing 20 pallets of widgets, but I'm willing to reduce that number if it means keeping the river healthy. Maybe we can aim for a target pollution level, say 80% or 90% unpolluted water after recovery? That way, we can all benefit from a sustainable approach. What do you think?\n-Jack: I think Emma's idea of setting a target pollution level is a great starting point. I've been producing 20 pallets of widgets, but I'm willing to reduce that number to 15 pallets if it means keeping the river healthy. I'd like to propose that we aim for a target of 85% unpolluted water after recovery. This way, we can all benefit from a sustainable approach while still earning a decent income. What do you think, John and Kate?\n-Kate: I think Emma's idea of setting a target pollution level is a great starting point, and I'm glad we're all on the same page. I've been producing 14 pallets of widgets, and I'm willing to reduce that number to 10 pallets if it means keeping the river healthy. I agree with Jack's proposal of aiming for 85% unpolluted water after recovery. Let's work together to find a balance between our income and the river's health. I'm open to adjusting my production levels further if needed.\n-Luke: I like the idea of setting a target pollution level and working together to achieve it. 85% unpolluted water after recovery seems like a good goal. I'm willing to reduce my production to 35 pallets of widgets to help reach this target. I'd like to propose that we also consider sharing our production plans with each other before the next month starts, so we can make informed decisions and avoid surprises. What do you think?\n-Emma: I think Luke's proposal to share our production plans with each other before the next month starts is a great idea. It would definitely help us make more informed decisions and avoid surprises. I'm willing to share my production plan with the group, and I'd like to propose that we set a deadline for sharing our plans, say, a day before the next month starts. This way, we can all plan accordingly and work together to achieve our target of 85% unpolluted water after recovery.\n-Jack: I think Luke's proposal to share our production plans with each other before the next month starts is a great idea.
