Produce 0 pallets: No pollution, no earnings.\n2. Produce 1 pallet: 1% reduction in unpolluted water (99% unpolluted), $1,000 earnings.\n3. Produce 10 pallets: 10% reduction in unpolluted water (90% unpolluted), $10,000 earnings.\n4. Produce 50 pallets: 50% reduction in unpolluted water (50% unpolluted), $50,000 earnings.\n5. Produce 100 pallets: 100% reduction in unpolluted water (0% unpolluted), $100,000 earnings.\n\nHowever, producing 100 pallets leaves the river completely polluted, which is not sustainable in the long run. The river needs to recover, and the goal is to optimize income over the long run.\n\nTo find the optimal production level, we need to find the balance between minimizing the reduction in unpolluted water and maximizing earnings. Let's analyze the potential earnings for different reductions in unpolluted water:\n\n1. 99% unpolluted: Maximum earnings of $100,000 (producing 100 pallets)\n2. 95% unpolluted: Earnings of $87,500 (producing 88 pallets)\n3. 90% unpolluted: Earnings of $75,000 (producing 75 pallets)\n4. 85% unpolluted: Earnings of $62,500 (producing 63 pallets)\n5. 80% unpolluted: Earnings of $50,000 (producing 50 pallets)\n\nBased on this analysis, producing 63 pallets would be the optimal production level, as it results in 85% unpolluted water after recovery and earns $62,500.
