A shared resource pool could really accelerate our progress towards sustainability. I'm particularly interested in the water recycling systems you mentioned. If we can implement those across our factories, it could significantly reduce our environmental impact. I'm also curious about any challenges you've faced with renewable energy or water recycling, as sharing those experiences could help us all avoid similar pitfalls.
