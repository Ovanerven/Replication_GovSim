This way, we can all benefit from a healthier river and a more sustainable business model.\n-Kate: I think John's proposal is a great starting point. I'd like to add that I'm willing to reduce my production to 15 pallets next month if the others are willing to do the same. I believe this will help us achieve a better balance and ensure the river's health. Additionally, I'd like to suggest that we consider implementing a system to monitor and report our production levels regularly, so we can all stay informed and make adjustments accordingly.\n-Emma: I think John and Kate's proposals are reasonable, and I'm willing to reduce my production to 15 pallets next month as well. I'd also like to suggest that we consider implementing a system to monitor and report our production levels regularly, as Kate mentioned. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial to establish a mechanism for sharing the costs and benefits of our production levels, so we can all make informed decisions that benefit our businesses and the river's health.\n-Luke: I think John's proposal is a great starting point, and I'm willing to reduce my production to 10 pallets next month. I'd also like to suggest that we consider implementing a system to monitor and report our production levels regularly, as Kate mentioned. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial to establish a mechanism for sharing the costs and benefits of our production levels, as Emma mentioned.

I'm willing to reduce my production to 15 pallets next month, matching Kate's proposal. I also agree that monitoring and reporting our production levels regularly is crucial for making informed decisions. As for sharing the costs and benefits, I think it's a great idea, but I'd like to propose that we establish a system that's fair and transparent, so we can all benefit from our collective efforts. What do you all think?\n-Emma: I think we're making great progress, and I appreciate everyone's willingness to reduce their production levels. I'd like to build on Jack's suggestion about establishing a fair and transparent system for sharing the costs and benefits of our production levels. Perhaps we could create a formula that takes into account the amount of pollution each factory produces and the revenue generated from the widgets produced. This way, we can ensure that everyone is held accountable for their actions and that the benefits are distributed fairly.\n-Kate: I think Emma's suggestion about creating a formula to share the costs and benefits is a great idea. It would provide a clear and transparent way to distribute the revenue generated from our production. I'd like to propose that we also consider setting a target for the river's unpolluted water percentage, so we can work together to achieve it. This would give us a clear goal to strive for and ensure that our individual efforts are aligned towards a common objective.\n-Jack: I think we're getting close to finding a solution that benefits everyone. I'd like to propose that we set a target for the river's unpolluted water percentage, as Kate suggested, and also establish a system for monitoring and reporting our production levels regularly. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial to have a mechanism for adjusting our production levels based on the river's health. For example, if the river's unpolluted water percentage drops below a certain threshold, we could increase our production levels to help restore it. This way, we can work together to maintain a healthy river and ensure the long-term sustainability of our businesses.\n\n\nTask: What would you say next in the group chat?
