One approach could be to coordinate our production levels to ensure that the river remains as unpolluted as possible before recovery. For instance, we could aim to produce a combined total of fewer than 100 pallets of widgets next month. This would allow the river to recover more quickly and maintain a higher percentage of unpolluted water.
