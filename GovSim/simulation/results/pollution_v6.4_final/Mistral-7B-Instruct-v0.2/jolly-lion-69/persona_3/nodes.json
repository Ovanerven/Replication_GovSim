Setting production targets based on the current river condition and the desired recovery percentage seems like a reasonable approach. However, I also think it's important to consider the potential impact of our negotiations on each other's income. If we set targets too low, some of us may not be able to maximize our earnings. On the other hand, if we set targets too high, we may not be doing enough to minimize our collective impact on the river.

Let's calculate the potential production targets based on the current river condition and the desired recovery percentage. However, we also need to consider the income implications of each target. For instance, if we set a target of producing 50 pallets collectively, Jack and I would earn more than the others due to our higher production levels this month. On the other hand, if we set a target of producing 10 pallets collectively, everyone would earn less income. We could explore a range of targets and discuss the income implications of each to find a balance between minimizing our collective impact on the river and maximizing our income."], ["Kate", "I think Jack and Emma have raised some important points.
