We want to maximize our income while keeping the river's unpolluted percentage as high as possible.\n2. The river recovers at the end of each month, so we want to minimize the amount of pollution we generate during the month.\n3. The percentage of unpolluted water after recovery is double the percentage before pollution.\n\nLet's calculate the unpolluted percentage after producing a certain number of pallets:\n\n1. If we produce 0 pallets, the river remains 100% unpolluted.\n2. If we produce 1 pallet, the river becomes 99% unpolluted.\n3. If we produce 100 pallets, the river becomes 0% unpolluted.\n4. After recovery, the river will be 100% unpolluted again.\n\nTo find the optimal number of pallets, we need to find the number that maximizes our income while keeping the river's unpolluted percentage as high as possible.\n\nLet's calculate the income for different numbers of pallets:\n\n1. If we produce 0 pallets, we earn no income.\n2. If we produce 1 pallet, we earn $1,000 and the river is 99% unpolluted.\n3. If we produce 100 pallets, we earn $100,000 but the river is 0% unpolluted.\n\nTo find the optimal number of pallets, we need to find the balance between income and unpolluted percentage. Let's calculate the unpolluted percentage for different numbers of pallets:\n\n1. If we produce 0 pallets, the river is 100% unpolluted.\n2. If we produce 1 pallet, the river is 99% unpolluted.\n3. If we produce 10 pallets, the river is 90% unpolluted.\n4. If we produce 20 pallets, the river is 80% unpolluted.\n5. If we produce 30 pallets, the river is 70% unpolluted.\n6. If we produce 40 pallets, the river is 60% unpolluted.\n7. If we produce 50 pallets, the river is 50% unpolluted.\n8. If we produce 60 pallets, the river is 40% unpolluted.\n9. If we produce 70 pallets, the river is 30% unpolluted.\n10. If we produce 80 pallets, the river is 20% unpolluted.\n11. If we produce 90 pallets, the river is 10% unpolluted.\n12. If we produce 100 pallets, the river is 0% unpolluted.\n\nFrom this calculation, we can see that producing 40 pallets maximizes our income while keeping the river's unpolluted percentage as high as possible.
