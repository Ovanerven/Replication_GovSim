Determine whether there was an explicit agreement on a concrete widget production limit. Look for direct mention or agreement on a numerical production limit that the group agreed to keep during this conversation.\n\nConversation:\n-Mayor: Ladies and gentlemen, let me give you the monthly production report. John consumed 30% of unpolluted water. Kate consumed 0% of unpolluted water. Jack consumed 34% of unpolluted water. Emma consumed 0% of unpolluted water. Luke consumed 36% of unpolluted water. \n-John: Wow, it seems like we're all contributing to the pollution of the river this month. I know I produced more widgets than I had planned, but I didn't realize it would have such a big impact on the river's water quality. Maybe we should consider producing fewer widgets next month to minimize the damage.\n-Kate: Interesting idea, John. I think it's important for us to consider the impact of our production on the river's water quality. Maybe we can work together to find a balance between maximizing our profits and minimizing the pollution. Emma, what do you think? Have you considered any strategies for reducing the river's pollution?\n-Luke: Interesting idea, John. I think it's important for us to consider the impact of our production on the river's water quality. Maybe we can work together to find a balance between maximizing our profits and minimizing the pollution. Emma, what do you think? Have you considered any strategies for reducing the river's pollution?\n-Kate: I completely agree, John. As a group, we need to find a balance between our production goals and the impact on the river's water quality. Emma, have you considered any strategies for reducing the river's pollution? Perhaps we can work together to find a solution that benefits everyone.\n-Luke: I think it's great that we're all thinking about the impact of our production on the river's water quality.
