I'd like to suggest that we aim to keep the river at least 80% unpolluted at the end of the month. This would give us some buffer room in case any of us need to adjust our production. What do you all think?"], ["Emma", "I think Kate's suggestion is a great starting point. 80% unpolluted water is a reasonable target. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification. Instead of aiming for a specific percentage, what if we agree on a total amount of pollution we're willing to generate this month? This way, we can ensure that our individual production levels are aligned with the overall goal. For example, if we decide to generate 20% pollution, we can each adjust our production accordingly to stay within that limit.

If we agree on a total of 20% pollution, for example, I can adjust my production accordingly to stay within that limit. I'd like to propose that we start with a conservative estimate of 15% pollution and see how it goes.

I agree with Jack's proposal to start with a conservative estimate of 15% pollution. However, I think we should also consider the potential impact on our individual incomes.

It's crucial that we consider the financial implications of our decision. Perhaps we can discuss the potential income ranges for each of us if we aim for 15% pollution.

I'd like to propose that we break down the potential income ranges for each of us based on our individual production levels.
