By working together, we can find a balance between our individual goals and the well-being of the river.

However, I'd like to propose a more specific goal: let's aim for a target pollution level of 65% or lower. This would give us a bit more buffer room to adjust our production while still ensuring the river's health. Additionally, I'd like to suggest that we consider implementing a system of \"pollution credits\" - if one of us produces less pollution than our agreed-upon target, we can \"bank\" those credits and use them to offset our production in future months. This could incentivize us to work together and make more sustainable choices."], ["Jack", "I like the idea of a target pollution level and the concept of pollution credits.
