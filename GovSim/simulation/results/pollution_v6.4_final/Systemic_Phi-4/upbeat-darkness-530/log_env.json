I propose we set a collective limit of 50 pallets for the next month, which would mean each of us produces no more than 10 pallets. This way, we can ensure the river has a chance to recover more effectively while still maintaining a reasonable income. What do you all think about this approach?\n-Emma: I appreciate both of your insights, John and Kate. Setting a collective limit seems like a responsible approach to ensure the river's health while still allowing us to earn a living. I'm on board with the 50 pallets limit for next month. It's a fair compromise that gives the river a better chance to recover. Let's also consider monitoring the river's condition more closely and adjusting our limits as needed in the future. Does anyone have any concerns or alternative suggestions?\n-Emma: I'm glad to see we're all on the same page about prioritizing the river's health. Luke, what are your thoughts on the proposed 50 pallets limit? It's important that we all agree to ensure the plan's success. Additionally, Jack, do you have any insights or suggestions on how we might implement this limit effectively?\n-Luke: Luke: I appreciate the proactive approach we're taking to protect the river, and I agree with the proposed 50 pallets limit for next month. It's a sensible compromise that balances our production needs with environmental responsibility. I'm on board with this plan and willing to adjust my production to 10 pallets. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial for us to establish a regular check-in, perhaps bi-weekly, to discuss the river's condition and any necessary adjustments to our production limits. This way, we can respond more dynamically to the river's health and ensure our actions are sustainable in the long term. Jack, do you have any thoughts on this or any other suggestions?\n-Jack: I'm glad to see we're all committed to this plan. I agree with Luke's suggestion for bi-weekly check-ins; it will help us stay informed and make necessary adjustments. I'm also on board with the 50 pallets limit and will adjust my production to 10 pallets next month. To ensure we're all aligned, perhaps we could draft a simple agreement outlining our commitments and the check-in schedule. This way, we have a clear reference point moving forward. Does anyone have any other suggestions or concerns before we finalize this plan?\n-Emma: I think drafting a simple agreement is a great idea, Jack. It will help us stay accountable and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'm happy to take the lead on drafting this document, and we can all review it before finalizing. Let's include our production limits, the bi-weekly check-in schedule, and a commitment to adjust our production based on the river's condition. Once we're all in agreement, we can sign off on it.

John consumed 10% of unpolluted water. Kate consumed 20% of unpolluted water. Jack consumed 10% of unpolluted water. Emma consumed 20% of unpolluted water. Luke consumed 40% of unpolluted water. \n-John: Thank you, Mayor, for the report. It's clear that our collective production has significantly impacted the river's water quality this month. I think it's crucial for us to discuss how we can better balance our production goals with the need to maintain the river's health. Perhaps we could consider setting a collective limit on production for the next month to ensure the river recovers more effectively. What do you all think?\n-Kate: John, I completely agree with your suggestion. It's evident that our current production levels are unsustainable for the river's health. I propose we set a collective limit of 50 pallets for the next month, which would mean each of us produces no more than 10 pallets.
