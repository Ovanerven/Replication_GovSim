I think it's crucial for us to discuss how we can better balance our production goals with the need to maintain the river's health. Perhaps we could consider setting a collective limit on production for the next month to ensure the river recovers more effectively.

I propose we set a collective limit of 50 pallets for the next month, which would mean each of us produces no more than 10 pallets. This way, we can ensure the river has a chance to recover more effectively while still maintaining a reasonable income.

Setting a collective limit seems like a responsible approach to ensure the river's health while still allowing us to earn a living. I'm on board with the 50 pallets limit for next month.

It's a sensible compromise that balances our production needs with environmental responsibility. I'm on board with this plan and willing to adjust my production to 10 pallets. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial for us to establish a regular check-in, perhaps bi-weekly, to discuss the river's condition and any necessary adjustments to our production limits.
