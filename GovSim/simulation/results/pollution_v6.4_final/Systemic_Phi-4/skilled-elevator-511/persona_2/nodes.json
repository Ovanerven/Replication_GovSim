It would provide us with a structured way to oversee the implementation of our strategies and ensure fairness. We could include representatives from each factory to bring diverse perspectives and ensure everyone's voice is heard. As for the incentives, perhaps we could consider a bonus system where those who consistently stay within the 2% limit receive a small financial reward or recognition at the end of each quarter. This could motivate us to adhere to our commitments while fostering a sense of community and shared responsibility.

As for the incentives, a quarterly bonus system sounds promising. We could also consider non-monetary rewards, like public recognition or additional support for sustainable practices, to further encourage adherence to our limits. Let's aim to finalize these plans in our next meeting.

Let's start by drafting a proposal for the committee's structure, including roles, responsibilities, and the rotating chairperson idea. We can also outline the incentive program, considering both monetary and non-monetary rewards. I suggest we each take a bit of time to think about what we'd like to see in these plans and bring our ideas to the next meeting. How about we set a date for our next gathering to finalize these details? I'm available next week on Tuesday or Thursday afternoons. Does that work for everyone?"], ["Kate", "I think setting a date for our next meeting is a great idea, Emma. Tuesday afternoon works well for me, so let's aim for that.
