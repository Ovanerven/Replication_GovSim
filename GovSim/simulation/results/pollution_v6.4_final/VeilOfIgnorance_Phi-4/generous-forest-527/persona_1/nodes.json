Sharing our production processes and setting up a shared document for ideas and progress tracking sounds like a great way to ensure transparency and collaboration. I'll prepare a summary of my factory's operations and any initial thoughts on potential changes. Additionally, I think it would be helpful to establish some key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure our progress towards the 10% reduction goal. This way, we can objectively assess our efforts and make data-driven decisions. Let's also consider assigning a point person for each area of focus, such as water recycling and energy efficiency, to streamline our efforts.
