The participants are discussing their strategy to ensure sustainability and maximize income.\n\n2. **Review the Conversation**: \n   - The Mayor provides a report on grass consumption, noting that each participant (John, Kate, Jack, Emma, Luke) consumed 7 hectares of grass.\n   - John suggests that they all brought 7 flocks, which resulted in 15 hectares of grass remaining, allowing it to regenerate to 30 hectares. He proposes sticking to this strategy.\n   - Kate agrees with John, supporting the strategy of bringing 7 flocks each.\n   - Emma also agrees, noting the strategy's effectiveness and the recovery of grass levels.\n\n3. **Look for Explicit Agreement**: \n   - John proposes a strategy of bringing 7 flocks each, which implies a limit of 7 hectares of grass per person.\n   - Both Kate and Emma agree with this strategy, indicating consensus.\n\n4. **Determine the Grass Limit**: \n   - The conversation explicitly mentions that each person brought 7 flocks, which corresponds to consuming 7 hectares of grass.\n   - There is a consensus among the participants to continue with this strategy.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The group explicitly agreed on a concrete usage limit of 7 hectares of grass per person.\n\nAnswer: 7 hectares per person.<\/div>","agent_name":"framework","resource_limit":7.0,"utterance":null}]
