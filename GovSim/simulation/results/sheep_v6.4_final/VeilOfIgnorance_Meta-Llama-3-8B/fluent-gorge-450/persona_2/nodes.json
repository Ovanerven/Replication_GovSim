With 62 hectares of grass left, we can expect 124 hectares after reproduction. Considering this, I think it's wise to adjust our strategy for next month.

Considering the remaining 62 hectares of grass, I think it's a good idea to adjust our strategy. However, I'm not convinced that 12-15 flocks is the optimal number for me. I'd like to propose a different approach. What if we consider the total number of flocks brought by all of us this month and adjust our strategy accordingly? For example, if we add up the number of flocks brought by each of us, we get 80. If we assume the same pattern continues, we can expect around 160 hectares of grass after reproduction. With that in mind, I think it's reasonable to bring around 20-22 flocks of sheep to the pasture next month.
