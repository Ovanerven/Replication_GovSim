It's always better to be prepared for the unexpected and having a buffer will give us a safety net in case the grass growth rate is lower than expected. I'm happy to adjust my strategy to aim for 18-22 flocks of sheep next month, which should help us achieve our target of leaving at least 50 hectares of grass and the buffer of 10-15 hectares. What do you all think about Emma's proposal?\n-Luke: I think Emma's proposal to leave a buffer of 10-15 hectares of grass for the next month is a great idea, and I'm happy to adjust my strategy accordingly.
