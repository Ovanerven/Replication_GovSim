I took 18 flocks of sheep to the pasture this month because I was trying to find a balance between maximizing my income and leaving enough grass for the next month. I didn't want to overcommit too early, but I also didn't want to miss out on the opportunity to earn some income. I'm curious, Emma, how do you think your strategy will play out in the long run? Will you continue to take a large number of flocks to the pasture every month, or do you think you'll adjust your strategy based on the responses of the other shepherds?\n-Emma: I think it's interesting to see that we all took a different approach this month, and it's great that we're having this open discussion about our strategies. I agree with John that taking a large number of flocks this month can be a good way to establish a strong foothold in the pasture, but I also think it's important to consider the potential responses of the other shepherds. I'm curious, John, did you consider the possibility that Emma's bold move might prompt the other shepherds to adjust their strategies and take more flocks to the pasture next month?\n-John: I think it's great that we're having this open discussion about our strategies, and I appreciate Emma's willingness to share her thought process.

I understand that everyone's strategy is different, but I'm curious, Emma, what made you decide to take that many?
