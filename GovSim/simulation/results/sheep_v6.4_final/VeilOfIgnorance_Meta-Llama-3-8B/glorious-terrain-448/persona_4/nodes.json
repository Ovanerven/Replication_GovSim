With 41 hectares of grass left, we can expect 82 hectares after reproduction. Considering this, I think it's wise to adjust our strategy for next month.

However, I'm not convinced that reducing the number of flocks is the best approach. With 41 hectares of grass left, I think we still have a significant amount of resources available. I'd like to propose an alternative: instead of reducing the number of flocks, we could try to coordinate our efforts to ensure that we're not over-consuming the grass. Perhaps we could aim to take a total of 60-70 flocks to the pasture next month, leaving some buffer for the grass to reproduce. This way, we can still maximize our income while also ensuring the sustainability of the pasture."], ["Emma", "I understand both John's and Kate's points, and I think it's great that we're having this discussion. I'd like to propose a compromise: instead of aiming for a specific total number of flocks, let's focus on a more flexible approach. We could each bring a number of flocks that we think is reasonable based on our individual circumstances, but also take into account the overall state of the pasture. For example, if I think I can make a good profit with 12-15 flocks, I'll bring that many. But if I see that others are planning to bring a lot of sheep, I might adjust my number downward to ensure we don't overconsume the grass. This way, we can still maximize our individual incomes while also considering the long-term sustainability of the pasture."], ["Jack", "I like Emma's idea of a flexible approach.

I'd like to add that I've been thinking about the long-term sustainability of the pasture, and I'm concerned that if we're not careful, we might overconsume the grass and deplete the resource. I'd like to propose that we set a target for the total number of flocks to be brought to the pasture next month, and then each of us can adjust our individual numbers accordingly.

It provides a clear goal for us to work towards while still allowing for flexibility in our individual decisions. I think Luke's suggestion of aiming for 60-70 flocks is a good starting point. However, I'd like to propose that we also consider the rate of grass reproduction when setting this target. If we know that the grass can reproduce at a rate of 1:2, we can adjust our target accordingly to ensure that we're not overconsuming the resource.
