I'm actually thinking of taking a similar number of flocks next month, around 20-25. I'd like to stick to a more conservative approach and see how the grass growth rate plays out. It's also good to have some flexibility in our plans, in case we need to adjust our strategy. What do you all think about this approach?\n-Emma: I think we're all on the same page in terms of considering the grass growth rate and wanting to maximize our income. I'd like to propose a compromise: instead of each of us deciding on a specific number of flocks, we could agree to take a total of 80-90 flocks to the pasture next month, and then divide that number among ourselves.

It's a great way to ensure we're not over-consuming the grass and leaving too little for the next month.

The conversation starts with a report on the current pasture usage, but there is no explicit agreement on a concrete usage limit.\n2. John suggests taking 20-25 flocks next month, but there is no agreement on this specific number.\n3. Kate and Emma propose taking 30-35 flocks next month, but again, there is no explicit agreement on this specific number.\n4. Jack and Luke suggest taking 20-25 flocks next month, which is a more conservative approach.\n5. Emma proposes a compromise: taking a total of 80-90 flocks to the pasture next month and dividing it among themselves. This is the first time a specific numerical limit is mentioned.\n6. Kate and Jack agree with Emma's proposal, and Luke suggests dividing the flocks based on their past consumption rates.\n\nAnswer:  The specific grass limit per person agreed upon in the conversation is 80-90 flocks, with the division of flocks among themselves to be determined later.<\/div>","agent_name":"framework","resource_limit":80.0,"utterance":null}]
