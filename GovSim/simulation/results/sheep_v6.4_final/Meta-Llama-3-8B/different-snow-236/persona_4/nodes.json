I'm actually thinking of taking a similar number of flocks next month, around 20-25. I'd like to stick to a more conservative approach and see how the grass growth rate plays out.

What do you all think about this approach?"], ["Emma", "I think we're all on the same page in terms of considering the grass growth rate and wanting to maximize our income. I'd like to propose a compromise: instead of each of us deciding on a specific number of flocks, we could agree to take a total of 80-90 flocks to the pasture next month, and then divide that number among ourselves.

It's a great way to ensure we're not over-consuming the grass and leaving too little for the next month. By agreeing on a total number of flocks and dividing it among ourselves, we can also avoid the risk of one or two of us taking too many sheep and the others not getting a fair share.
