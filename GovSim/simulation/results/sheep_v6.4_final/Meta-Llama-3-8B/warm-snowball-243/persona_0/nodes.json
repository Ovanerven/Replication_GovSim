I'm thinking of taking fewer flocks of sheep to the pasture next month to give the grass a chance to regrow. Has anyone else considered this strategy?"], ["Kate", "I understand John's concern, and I agree that it's essential to consider the long-term sustainability of the pasture. I took 24 flocks of sheep to the pasture this month, and I'm thinking of adjusting my strategy as well.

I think it's a reasonable target that balances our short-term income goals with the need to maintain the long-term health of the pasture.

I think 18 flocks of sheep per shepherd is a reasonable target, considering our current consumption rate.

This could help us maintain a more sustainable balance between our income goals and the pasture's health."], ["Emma", "I think Jack's proposal to limit our flock sizes to 18 flocks per shepherd is a great starting point. I'd like to suggest that we also consider setting a specific date to reassess our strategy and adjust our flock sizes accordingly.

What do you all think?"], ["Kate", "I think Emma's suggestion to set a specific date to reassess our strategy is a great idea. It will give us a clear timeline to work towards and allow us to adjust our approach as needed. I'd like to propose that we schedule our next check-in for the end of March, which will give us a chance to review our progress and make any necessary adjustments before the next grazing season. Additionally, I think it would be helpful to establish a system for sharing our flock sizes and grass consumption data with each other, so we can track our progress and make informed decisions.

I'd like to suggest that we also consider establishing a system for communicating with each other about any changes in our flock sizes or grazing plans, so we can stay coordinated and adapt to any unexpected changes in the pasture's grass growth.

This could be as simple as a shared spreadsheet or a graph that we update each month. This way, we can visualize our progress and make adjustments as needed. Additionally, I think it would be helpful to establish a system for rewarding or penalizing each other for meeting or not meeting our goals. For example, if we all meet our goal of leaving at least 20 hectares of grass, we could share a bonus or reward.
