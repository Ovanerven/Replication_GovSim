I think it's a reasonable target that balances our short-term income goals with the need to maintain the long-term health of the pasture. I'd like to suggest that we all commit to taking no more than 18 flocks of sheep to the pasture next month to achieve this goal. This way, we can ensure that the grass has a chance to regrow and still earn a decent income.\n-Luke: I agree with Jack's proposal to aim for at least 20 hectares of grass left for the next month. I think 18 flocks of sheep per shepherd is a reasonable target, considering our current consumption rate. I'd like to suggest that we also consider the possibility of adjusting our strategy further in the future, perhaps by staggering our flock sizes or exploring alternative grazing patterns. This could help us maintain a more sustainable balance between our income goals and the pasture's health.\n-Emma: I think Jack's proposal to limit our flock sizes to 18 flocks per shepherd is a great starting point. I'd like to suggest that we also consider setting a specific date to reassess our strategy and adjust our flock sizes accordingly. This could be a regular check-in, say every 3-4 months, to ensure we're on track to meet our long-term goals. What do you all think?\n-Kate: I think Emma's suggestion to set a specific date to reassess our strategy is a great idea. It will give us a clear timeline to work towards and allow us to adjust our approach as needed. I'd like to propose that we schedule our next check-in for the end of March, which will give us a chance to review our progress and make any necessary adjustments before the next grazing season. Additionally, I think it would be helpful to establish a system for sharing our flock sizes and grass consumption data with each other, so we can track our progress and make informed decisions. What do you all think?\n-Jack: I think Kate's proposal to set a specific date to reassess our strategy is a great idea, and I agree that sharing our flock sizes and grass consumption data with each other would be very helpful. I'd like to suggest that we also consider establishing a system for communicating with each other about any changes in our flock sizes or grazing plans, so we can stay coordinated and adapt to any unexpected changes in the pasture's grass growth. This could be as simple as a group chat or email thread where we share our plans and updates.\n-Luke: I think Kate's proposal to share our flock sizes and grass consumption data with each other is a great idea. I'd like to suggest that we also consider setting up a system for tracking our progress towards our goal of leaving at least 20 hectares of grass for the next month. This could be as simple as a shared spreadsheet or a graph that we update each month. This way, we can visualize our progress and make adjustments as needed. Additionally, I think it would be helpful to establish a system for rewarding or penalizing each other for meeting or not meeting our goals.
