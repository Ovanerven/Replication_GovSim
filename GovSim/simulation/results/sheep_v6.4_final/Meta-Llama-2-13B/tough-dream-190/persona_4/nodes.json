I know we're all trying to maximize our income, but I think we should be careful not to overgraze the pasture. We don't want to risk damaging the land or depleting the resources for future months.

As we all know, the pasture is a shared resource, and we need to make sure we're not overgrazing it. Maybe we can set some guidelines for next month, like limiting the number of flocks each of us can bring or only taking a certain percentage of the available grass. That way, we can still maximize our income while ensuring the long-term health of the pasture."], ["Emma", "I think we all need to be more mindful of our grazing habits and work together to ensure the long-term health of the pasture.
