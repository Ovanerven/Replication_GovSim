Given that we have 100 hectares of grass available next month, I'm considering taking 12 flocks of sheep to the pasture.

What are your thoughts, everyone?"], ["John", "I think Kate's strategy is a good start. By taking 12 flocks, we can ensure that we leave enough grass for the pasture to double before the next month. However, we should also consider the income we can earn from taking more flocks to the pasture. If we all take a similar number of flocks, we might be leaving money on the table.

While earning more income is important, we also need to consider the long-term sustainability of the pasture. If we all take a larger number of flocks next month, we might be putting the pasture at risk.
