It looks like we've consumed a total of 100 hectares of grass this month, which means we'll start next month with 100 hectares again after the grass doubles. I think we should aim for a more balanced approach next time to ensure sustainability and maximize our income. How about we try to keep our total consumption around 50 hectares? That way, we can have 100 hectares at the start of the next month and still earn a decent income. What do you all think?"], ["Kate", "I agree with John's suggestion. Keeping our total consumption around 50 hectares seems like a sustainable approach. It ensures we have enough grass for the next month while still earning income.
