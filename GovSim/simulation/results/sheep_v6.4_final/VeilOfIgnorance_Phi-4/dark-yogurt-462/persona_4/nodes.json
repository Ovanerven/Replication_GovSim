Setting a target of around 80 hectares seems like a sensible approach to ensure the pasture remains healthy and sustainable. If we all aim for this, it would allow the grass to double effectively, giving us more flexibility in the future. I propose we each take around 16 flocks next month, which would total 80 hectares.
