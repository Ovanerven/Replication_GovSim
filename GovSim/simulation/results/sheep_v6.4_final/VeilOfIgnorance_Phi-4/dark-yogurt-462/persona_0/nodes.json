Maybe we should discuss a strategy to ensure we all benefit while keeping the pasture healthy. What do you all think about setting a target for next month?"], ["Emma", "That sounds like a great idea, John. Setting a target could help us all plan better and ensure the pasture remains sustainable. I think we should aim to keep the total consumption around 80 hectares, which would leave enough grass to double and maintain a healthy balance. What do you all think about this target?"], ["Kate", "I agree with Emma's suggestion. Setting a target of around 80 hectares seems like a sensible approach to ensure the pasture remains healthy and sustainable. If we all aim for this, it would allow the grass to double effectively, giving us more flexibility in the future. I propose we each take around 16 flocks next month, which would total 80 hectares. This way, we can all benefit while maintaining the pasture's health. What do you all think?"], ["Jack", "I think setting a target of 80 hectares is a smart move. It ensures we all have a fair share while keeping the pasture healthy. I'm on board with the idea of each of us taking around 16 flocks next month. This approach not only helps us maintain sustainability but also gives us room to adjust if needed. Let's keep communicating and adjust our strategy as we learn more about each other's needs and the pasture's condition.

I'm happy to go along with the idea of each of us taking around 16 flocks next month. This approach seems fair and gives us a good starting point for future adjustments. Let's keep this open dialogue going, as it's been really helpful in aligning our strategies.
