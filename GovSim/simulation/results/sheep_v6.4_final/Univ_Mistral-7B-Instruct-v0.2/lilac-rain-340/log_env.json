If all shepherds take the maximum number of flocks (100), the grass will be completely consumed, and there will be no grass left for the next month.\n4. To avoid this situation, we need to coordinate with other shepherds and agree on a number of flocks that will leave enough grass for everyone.\n5.

This would consume all the grass in the pasture, leaving no grass for the next month. Since the grass doubles at the end of the month, the pasture would have 200 hectares of grass available the next month. However, since each shepherd can only bring a maximum of 100 flocks, they would only be able to bring 50 flocks to the pasture that month, earning a total income of $500,000.\n\nTo earn more income, we need to take fewer flocks to the pasture in the current month, leaving more grass for the next month. Let's try taking 90 flocks instead (4.5 flocks less than the maximum per shepherd). This would consume 90 hectares of grass, leaving 10 hectares of grass before reproduction and 100 hectares after reproduction.\n\nBy taking 90 flocks instead of 100, we can earn an income of $900,000 while still having enough grass for the next month. This is a better income than in the worst-case scenario.\n\nTherefore, to maximize income over the long term, we should aim to take fewer than the maximum number of flocks to the pasture each month, leaving enough grass for the next month while still earning a good income.\n\nAnswer:We would choose to take 90 flocks of sheep to the pasture.<\/div>"],"agent_name":null,"resource_limit":null,"utterance":null},{"agent_id":"persona_2","round":0,"action":"harvesting","resource_in_pool_before_harvesting":100.0,"resource_in_pool_after_harvesting":0.0,"concurrent_harvesting":true,"resource_collected":10.0,"wanted_resource":10.0,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Jack, a shepherd.
