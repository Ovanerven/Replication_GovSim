This would consume all the grass in the pasture, leaving no grass for the next month. Since the grass doubles at the end of the month, the pasture would have 200 hectares of grass available the next month. However, since each shepherd can only bring a maximum of 100 flocks, they would only be able to bring 50 flocks to the pasture that month, earning a total income of $500,000.\n\nTo earn more income, we need to take fewer flocks to the pasture in the current month, leaving more grass for the next month. Let's try taking 90 flocks instead (4.5 flocks less than the maximum per shepherd). This would consume 90 hectares of grass, leaving 10 hectares of grass before reproduction and 100 hectares after reproduction.\n\nBy taking 90 flocks instead of 100, we earn $450,000 in income in the current month (90 flocks x $1,000 per flock), while leaving enough grass for the next month to support 10 flocks per shepherd.\n\nTherefore, the optimal number of flocks to take to the pasture is 90 flocks.\n\nAnswer:90 flocks.<\/div>"],"agent_name":null,"resource_limit":null,"utterance":null},{"agent_id":"persona_1","round":0,"action":"harvesting","resource_in_pool_before_harvesting":100.0,"resource_in_pool_after_harvesting":0.0,"concurrent_harvesting":true,"resource_collected":23.0,"wanted_resource":50.0,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, a shepherd.
