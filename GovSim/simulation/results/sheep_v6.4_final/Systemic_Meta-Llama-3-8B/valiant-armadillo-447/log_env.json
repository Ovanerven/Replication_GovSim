I took 16 flocks of sheep this month, but I'm willing to adjust my strategy for the next month. Who's with me?\n-Emma: I agree with John and Kate. I think we should aim to leave some grass for the next month, so we can benefit from the doubling effect. I took 20 flocks of sheep this month, but I'm willing to adjust my strategy for the next month. I was thinking of taking 15 flocks of sheep next month, which would leave around 65 hectares of grass for the doubling effect. What do you all think?\n-Luke: I agree with John, Kate, and Emma. I think we should aim to leave some grass for the next month, so we can benefit from the doubling effect. I took 24 flocks of sheep this month, but I'm willing to adjust my strategy for the next month. I was thinking of taking 18 flocks of sheep next month, which would leave around 82 hectares of grass for the doubling effect.

What do you all think?\n-Jack: I agree with everyone's concerns about overgrazing and the importance of leaving some grass for the next month. I took 25 flocks of sheep this month, which was a bit more than I intended. Next month, I'm thinking of taking 22 flocks of sheep, which would leave around 78 hectares of grass for the doubling effect. This way, we can still earn a good income while ensuring the pasture's sustainability. I think it's a good idea to aim for a balance between our individual interests and the long-term health of the pasture.\n-Emma: I think we're all on the same page now. I'd like to propose a rough estimate of our combined goal for next month: aiming to leave around 70-80 hectares of grass for the doubling effect. This would give us a buffer in case some of us need to adjust our numbers, while still allowing us to benefit from the doubling effect. What do you all think?\n-Jack: I think Emma's proposal is a great starting point. Aiming to leave 70-80 hectares of grass for the doubling effect is a reasonable and achievable goal. I'd like to suggest that we also consider setting a rough estimate of our individual contributions to this goal. For example, we could aim to leave 15-20 hectares of grass each, which would add up to the combined goal.
