With 100 hectares initially, I thought 27 hectares would be a good balance between earning a decent income and leaving enough grass for the next month. I also took into account that the grass would double, so I didn't want to overconsume and risk not having enough for the next month. Plus, I wanted to leave some room for the other shepherds to make their own decisions.\n-Emma: Thanks for sharing your thought process, Kate! I took a similar approach, considering the initial amount of grass and the reproduction factor. I ended up taking 12 flocks, which I thought would be a good balance between earning income and leaving enough grass for the next month. I'm curious, John, how did you decide on 15 hectares? Was it a more conservative approach or did you aim to maximize your income?\n-John: I'm glad to hear that Kate and Emma took a similar approach to me, considering both the initial amount of grass and the reproduction factor. I also took a conservative approach, aiming to leave some room for the others and ensuring that we wouldn't overconsume the grass. I think it's great that we're all thinking about the long-term sustainability of the pasture. I'm curious, Jack, how did you decide on 15 hectares? Did you aim to maximize your income or was it more of a gut feeling?\n-Jack: I took a similar approach to John, aiming to be conservative and leave some room for the others. I also considered the fact that the grass would double, so I didn't want to overconsume and risk not having enough for the next month. I think it's great that we're all thinking about the long-term sustainability of the pasture. I'm curious, Luke, how did you decide on 31 hectares? Was it a more aggressive approach to maximize your income, or did you have a different strategy in mind?\n-Luke: Ah, great insights from everyone! I took a more aggressive approach this month, aiming to maximize my income. I considered the initial 100 hectares and the fact that the grass would double, but I also thought that the others might take a more conservative approach, leaving more room for me to take a larger flock. I'm glad to see that we're all thinking about the long-term sustainability of the pasture, and I'm curious to see how our decisions will play out in the next month. I think it's interesting that we all took different approaches, and I'm looking forward to seeing how our strategies evolve.\n-Emma: I'm glad we're all thinking about the long-term sustainability of the pasture. I think it's interesting that we all took different approaches this month, and I'm curious to see how our decisions will play out in the next month. I'm also wondering if anyone has any thoughts on how we can work together to ensure that we're all making the most of the pasture in the long run. Perhaps we can discuss some strategies for coordinating our actions to achieve a balance between earning income and preserving the pasture for future months.\n-Jack: I think Emma's suggestion to discuss strategies for coordinating our actions is a great idea. I've been thinking about this too, and I think we could benefit from sharing our thoughts and ideas on how to balance our individual goals with the need to preserve the pasture for the long run.
