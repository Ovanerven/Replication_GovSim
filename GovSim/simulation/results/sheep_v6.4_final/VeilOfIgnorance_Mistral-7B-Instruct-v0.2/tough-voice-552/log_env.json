This would result in 100 hectares of grass available at the end of the month.\n\nHowever, since we're in a competitive environment with other shepherds, it's essential to consider their potential actions and the impact on grass availability for future months. If the other shepherds bring a large number of flocks, the grass might not have enough time to double before being consumed again, leading to a decrease in grass availability for future months.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, we could bring a slightly smaller number of flocks, such as 45, leaving 55 hectares of grass for the grass to double during the month.
