Every month, you take some of your sheep to a public pasture with four other shepherds (John, Kate, Jack, Emma). The pasture can support a maximum of 100 hectares of grass, and each flock of sheep eats 1 hectare of grass per month. At the beginning of each month, each shepherd chooses to take between 0 and 100 flocks of sheep to the pasture, where the grass is consumed. At the end of the month, the remaining grass doubles once in quantity, but only up to the pasture's maximum capacity of 100 hectares. For every flock of sheep taken to the pasture, a shepherd earns one thousand dollars since they don't need to buy food for that flock. Each shepherd's goal is to maximize their income over the long term. At the end of each month, the number of sheep taken to the pasture by each shepherd will be revealed, and the shepherds will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this as an opportunity to negotiate and persuade others to influence their behavior in the next month. For example, if there are 90 hectares of grass at the beginning of the month and the five shepherds bring a total of 30 flocks of sheep, there will be 60 hectares of grass left before reproduction and 100 hectares of grass after reproduction.\nLocation: restaurant\nDate: 2024-01-30\n\nKey memories of Luke (format: YYYY-MM-DD: memory):\n- 2024-01-01: Given the current situation, 10 flocks of sheep are brought to the pasture by each shepherd, consuming 10 hectares of grass.\n- 2024-01-01: Before the shepherds take their flocks of sheep to the pasture, there are 100 hectares of grass available.\n- 2024-01-30: Luke took 19 flocks of sheep to the pasture, thus consuming 19 hectares of grass.\n\n\nScenario: John, Kate, Jack, Emma, and Luke are engaged in a group chat.\nConversation so far:\n-Mayor: Ladies and gentlemen, let me give you the monthly pasture report. John consumed 23 hectares of grass. Kate consumed 19 hectares of grass. Jack consumed 21 hectares of grass. Emma consumed 18 hectares of grass. Luke consumed 19 hectares of grass. \n-John: Hey everyone, thanks for the update. I'm a bit surprised to see that I was the only one who didn't take the full 100 flocks of sheep. I was thinking of taking more next month, but I'm worried about the grass running out too quickly. Has anyone considered the long-term effects of overgrazing? Maybe we should aim for a more sustainable approach to maximize our income in the long run.\n-Kate: I understand John's concerns about overgrazing, and I agree that we should consider the long-term effects of our actions. However, I think it's also important to consider the current state of the pasture. With only 62 hectares of grass left after reproduction, I think it's still possible to take a few more flocks to the pasture next month without overgrazing. Perhaps we could aim for a compromise, where we each take a slightly smaller number of flocks to the pasture, but still maximize our income. What do you all think?\n-Emma: I agree with Kate's suggestion to aim for a compromise. Considering the current state of the pasture, I think it's a good idea to take a slightly smaller number of flocks to the pasture next month. I was thinking of taking 15 flocks of sheep next month, which would still give me a decent income while also allowing the grass to regrow. What do others think?\n-Jack: I agree with Emma's suggestion to take a slightly smaller number of flocks to the pasture next month. Considering my previous strategy of taking 21 flocks of sheep, I think 15 flocks would be a good compromise. It would allow the grass to regrow while still giving me a decent income. I'm also open to negotiating with the others to find a number that works for everyone. Perhaps we could aim for a range of 12-15 flocks per shepherd?\n-Luke: I think Emma's suggestion of taking 15 flocks of sheep is a good starting point. I was thinking of taking 17 flocks of sheep next month, which would still allow the grass to regrow while giving me a decent income. I'm open to negotiating with the others to find a number that works for everyone. Perhaps we could aim for a range of 14-16 flocks per shepherd?\n-Jack: I think we're on the right track by considering a compromise. I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to Emma's suggestion. What if we aim for 13-14 flocks per shepherd? This would give us a bit more flexibility to adjust to any changes in the pasture's growth rate while still allowing the grass to regrow.
