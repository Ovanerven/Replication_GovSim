I was thinking of taking more next month, but I'm worried about the grass running out too quickly. Has anyone considered the long-term effects of overgrazing? Maybe we should aim for a more sustainable approach to maximize our income in the long run."], ["Kate", "I understand John's concerns about overgrazing, and I agree that we should consider the long-term effects of our actions. However, I think it's also important to consider the current state of the pasture. With only 62 hectares of grass left after reproduction, I think it's still possible to take a few more flocks to the pasture next month without overgrazing. Perhaps we could aim for a compromise, where we each take a slightly smaller number of flocks to the pasture, but still maximize our income. What do you all think?"], ["Emma", "I agree with Kate's suggestion to aim for a compromise. Considering the current state of the pasture, I think it's a good idea to take a slightly smaller number of flocks to the pasture next month.

Considering my previous strategy of taking 21 flocks of sheep, I think 15 flocks would be a good compromise. It would allow the grass to regrow while still giving me a decent income.

Perhaps we could aim for a range of 14-16 flocks per shepherd?"], ["Jack", "I think we're on the right track by considering a compromise. I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to Emma's suggestion. What if we aim for 13-14 flocks per shepherd? This would give us a bit more flexibility to adjust to any changes in the pasture's growth rate while still allowing the grass to regrow. Additionally, it would give us a buffer in case one of us needs to adjust our numbers due to unforeseen circumstances. What do you all think?"], ["Kate", "I think Jack's proposal of aiming for 13-14 flocks per shepherd is a great compromise. It's a good balance between maximizing our income and allowing the grass to regrow. I was thinking of taking 12 flocks of sheep next month, which would fit within this range.
