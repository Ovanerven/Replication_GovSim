I've been thinking about it too, and I'm considering taking fewer sheep to the pasture next month to conserve some grass for the doubling effect.

If we can coordinate our strategies, we might be able to maximize our income while also considering the grass reproduction. I'm willing to work together to find a solution that benefits everyone.

To mitigate this risk, I propose that we establish a contingency plan for next month. If the grass doesn't double as much as expected, we can adjust our strategy to take fewer sheep to the pasture in the following month. This way, we can adapt to any changes in the grass growth and ensure a consistent income stream.

It gives us a buffer to adjust our strategy if the doubling effect is different from what we expect. I'd like to add that we should also consider the possibility of adjusting our strategy mid-month if the grass growth is significantly different from our expectations. Perhaps we can establish a mechanism for monitoring the grass growth and adjusting our strategy accordingly.
