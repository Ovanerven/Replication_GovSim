I think it's a good way to ensure we're all earning a good income while also being mindful of the grass's growth. I'm willing to compromise and adjust my target to 23-25 flocks of sheep next month.

Reviewing our past consumption patterns and sharing our data can definitely help us make more informed decisions.

This way, we can easily review our past consumption patterns and make adjustments as needed.
