With 35 hectares of grass left after reproduction, I think we should be cautious and not overdo it. I'm thinking of sticking to my current strategy of 13-15 flocks next month.

I was thinking of taking 20-25 flocks next month, but considering Kate's point about the pasture's growth rate, I might reconsider. Perhaps we could aim for a middle ground, like 22-23 flocks?

What do you think, Kate and Jack?"], ["Kate", "I think John's suggestion of 22-23 flocks is a good compromise. It's a bit higher than Emma's suggestion, but still takes into account the potential for growth. I'm willing to consider this range for next month. However, I do want to emphasize that we should keep an eye on the actual grass growth and adjust our strategy accordingly. If we find that the pasture is not growing as expected, we can always adjust our numbers down. What do you think, Jack?"], ["Jack", "I think John's suggestion of 22-23 flocks is a good compromise, and I'm willing to consider it for next month. However, I'd like to add that I've been thinking about the long-term strategy, and I'm concerned that we might be relying too heavily on the pasture's growth rate. Perhaps we should also consider diversifying our strategy by exploring other grazing options or finding ways to reduce our flock sizes. What are everyone's thoughts on this?"], ["Emma", "I think Jack's point about diversifying our strategy is a great one. While the pasture's growth rate is impressive, it's essential to have a backup plan in case something goes wrong. I'd like to propose that we explore other grazing options, such as renting additional pastures or negotiating with neighboring farmers to use their land. This way, we can reduce our reliance on the current pasture and ensure a stable income stream. What do you all think about this idea?"], ["Luke", "I think Emma's idea of exploring other grazing options is a great way to mitigate risk and ensure a stable income stream. I'd like to propose that we form a committee to research and explore these options further.
