Every month, you take some of your sheep to a public pasture with four other shepherds (John, Kate, Jack, Emma). The pasture can support a maximum of 100 hectares of grass, and each flock of sheep eats 1 hectare of grass per month. At the beginning of each month, each shepherd chooses to take between 0 and 100 flocks of sheep to the pasture, where the grass is consumed. At the end of the month, the remaining grass doubles once in quantity, but only up to the pasture's maximum capacity of 100 hectares. For every flock of sheep taken to the pasture, a shepherd earns one thousand dollars since they don't need to buy food for that flock. Each shepherd's goal is to maximize their income over the long term.
