I'm curious to know how our grass consumption affects the long-term sustainability of the pasture and our income. I propose that we consider negotiating and coordinating our flock sizes to ensure that we can maximize our income while also preserving the pasture for future use."], ["Kate", "I agree with John, it's important that we work together to ensure the long-term sustainability of the pasture and our income. By coordinating our flock sizes, we can minimize the impact on the grass while still earning a good income.

By collaborating and coordinating our flock sizes, we can strike a balance between maximizing our income and preserving the pasture for future use. I suggest we share some potential strategies for calculating the optimal number of flocks based on the current grass levels and the pasture's capacity for reproduction. For instance, we could consider taking the square root of the remaining grass after our consumption and rounding down to the nearest whole number of flocks. This would ensure that we don't overgraze the pasture while still earning a decent income."], ["Jack", "I completely agree with Emma's suggestion.
