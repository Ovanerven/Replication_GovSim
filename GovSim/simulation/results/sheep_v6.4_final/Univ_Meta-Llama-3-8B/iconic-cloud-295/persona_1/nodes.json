For example, John and Luke, who consumed the most grass this month, could take the smallest number of flocks next month, while Kate and I, who consumed less, could take a slightly larger number.

It's a practical way to implement the rotation system we discussed earlier. I'm willing to work with the group to divide the pasture into sections and create a schedule for the rotation. I also think it would be helpful to establish a system for monitoring the grass growth and adjusting our strategy as needed.
