John consumed 10 hectares of grass. Kate consumed 10 hectares of grass. Jack consumed 10 hectares of grass. Emma consumed 10 hectares of grass.

I think we should consider being more mindful of our consumption next month to ensure the grass has a chance to regrow. What are everyone's thoughts on this?\n-Kate: I agree with John, we should be more mindful of our consumption next month. I think we should aim to take no more than 5-7 flocks of sheep to the pasture to give the grass a chance to regrow. This way, we can ensure a sustainable income in the long run. Plus, with the grass doubling every month, we'll have a bigger supply to work with in the future.\n-Emma: I agree with John and Kate, we should be more mindful of our consumption next month. I think we should aim to take around 5-7 flocks of sheep to the pasture as well. Additionally, I'd like to propose that we consider forming a rotation system where we take turns taking more or fewer flocks to the pasture each month to ensure a balanced consumption.

I'd like to propose that we establish a rotation system where we take turns taking 5-7 flocks of sheep to the pasture each month.

What do you all think?\n-Luke: I think a rotation system is a great idea, and I'm open to the proposal. However, I'd like to suggest that we also consider the potential benefits of taking a few more flocks to the pasture in the short term. Since the grass doubles every month, we can afford to take a few more flocks this month and still have plenty of grass left over for the future. I'm thinking of taking 15-20 flocks of sheep to the pasture next month. What do you all think?\n-Emma: I understand Luke's point about taking a few more flocks to the pasture in the short term, but I'm concerned that it might set a bad precedent for the future. If we take 15-20 flocks of sheep to the pasture next month, it might be difficult to adjust to a more sustainable consumption rate later on. I think it's better to establish a rotation system and stick to it, rather than trying to take advantage of the doubling effect in the short term.
