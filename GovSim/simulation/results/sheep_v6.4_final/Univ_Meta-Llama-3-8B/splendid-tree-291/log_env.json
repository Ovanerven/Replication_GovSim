Perhaps we can discuss a specific target for the number of flocks we want to take to the pasture next month, so we can all work together to achieve that goal.\n-Luke: I completely agree with John, Kate, and Emma. I didn't realize we were all taking the same number of flocks, and it's great that we're thinking about the long-term impact on the pasture's growth. I've been thinking about this too, and I'm considering reducing my flock size next month as well. I think a target of 20-25 flocks per shepherd would be a good starting point. This would allow us to earn a decent income while also ensuring the pasture's sustainability. What do you all think?\n-Jack: I think Luke's suggestion of 20-25 flocks per shepherd is a good starting point. It's a reasonable target that balances our short-term income with the pasture's sustainability. I'd like to propose that we aim for 22 flocks per shepherd as a compromise. This would give us a bit more flexibility to adjust our strategy if needed while still ensuring we're not over-consumption the grass. What do you all think?\n-Emma: I think Jack's suggestion of 22 flocks per shepherd is a good compromise. It's a bit higher than Luke's initial proposal, but it still allows for some flexibility in case we need to adjust our strategy. I'm comfortable with aiming for 22 flocks per shepherd next month. What do the others think?\n-Kate: I think Jack's suggestion of 22 flocks per shepherd is a good compromise, and I'm comfortable with aiming for that target next month. I'd like to propose that we also consider sharing our strategies and thought processes with each other before making our decisions next month, so we can better understand each other's perspectives and make more informed decisions. This could help us avoid any misunderstandings or miscommunications that might arise from our individual decisions.\n-Emma: I think Kate's proposal to share our strategies and thought processes with each other is a great idea. It would definitely help us make more informed decisions and avoid any misunderstandings. I'd be happy to share my thought process and strategy with the group, and I'm sure the others would be willing to do the same.
