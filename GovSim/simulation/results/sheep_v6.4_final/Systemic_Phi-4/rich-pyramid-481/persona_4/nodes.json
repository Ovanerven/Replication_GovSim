I'm available next week, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to share our experiences and learn from each other. I've found that closely monitoring the health of my flock and adjusting their diet accordingly has helped me manage their size more efficiently. I'm eager to hear what strategies have worked for the rest of you. Let's aim for a time that suits everyone, and I'll make sure to send out a calendar invite once we've decided. Looking forward to our meeting and to strengthening our collaboration for the benefit of the pasture and our flocks!"], ["Emma", "I'm glad we're all on the same page, John.
